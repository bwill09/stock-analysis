# stock-analysis

## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to aid Steve, a recent graduate with a degree in finance. Steve aims to help his parents who are passionate about green energy. Their believe is that; by the time fossil fuel runs out there will be more dependence on other forms of energy production. While there are many forms of energy production to invest in like; hydroelectric, geothermal and bioenergy. Steve parents haven’t covered much research into the industry, but decided to invest all their money into ‘daqo’, which ticker is DQ. Daqo is new energy corporation, that produce silicon wafers for solar cells. Steve wants to help his parents assort their portfolio, therefore he promise to review and/or analyze some other green energy stocks. 

### Finding 

In 2018 ‘Daqo’ plunged 63 %. This suggest it would have been a bad investment for Steve’s parents. See attached images for reference. He would want to consider different stocks like ENPH and RUN.

#### Summary 

There are benefits to refactoring codes such as; it speeds optimization, which allow code execution to run faster (see attached original versus refactored code execution time image), easier to read and understand (see attached original versus refactored code image), thus easier to maintain, too. In contrary, refactoring can be time consuming and may leave you in limbo where you get confused and feel lost. I experienced this while refactoring to increase the ticker index, and output arrays. I spent good amount of time feeling lost. Eventually, my script ran faster and was simpler to understand, with the help from the AskBCS Learning Assistant platform.

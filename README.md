In contrary, refactoring can be time consuming and may leave you in limbo where you get confused and feel lost. I experienced this while refactoring to increase the ticker index, and output arrays. I spent good amount of time feeling lost. Eventually, my script ran faster and was simpler to understand, with the help from the AskBCS Learning Assistant platform.
